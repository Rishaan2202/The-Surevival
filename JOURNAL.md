## 10/7/2025 - Day 1! Let's Begin!!!  

Yooo!!! so it's the Day 1 and I have started making this ultimate Survival tool! I have decided the ESP32 as the MCU. I also have a few other components in my mind, like BME280, load sensors etc. I have started making a schematic on KiCad and have already added the ESP32 in it. I thought that the ESP32-S3 was not available in LCSC, but I found ESP32-WROOM-32E-N4 in stock on LCSC! I changed the MCU with it and I also added a BME280 to the schematic. Take a look at the schematic:-

## 10/12/2025 11:51 AM - Day-2! Progress!!  

So I did the USB Type-C power input connection today for my ESP. I took help from the 'Custom Devboard' guide and the ESP32 datasheet for this, but I can't figure out where to connect the D+ and D- pins! but don't worry, I'll do something for them! Take a look at the Schematic now:-

## 10/12/2025 11:53 AM - Day-3! Even more progress!!!  

Yeah! You see the schematic, it doesn't look like a day 3 schematic but yeah, it is! So today I tried to search for the Load sensors, but couldn't find any SMD one, so I will think upon it. I also tried to figure out that D+ and D- pin thingy, but couldn't come to any conclusion. So I asked for it on #electronics. I hope to get some answers on that. The major thing done today is the connection for BME280 sensor!!! Yeah, it's a great achievement for me!:-

## 10/14/2025 - Day 4! Done with the USB-to-UART thing!!!  

I did it! One of my friend (Teammate in another project) told me that I had to use the USB to UART feature for the transmission of Data between the MCU and the coding Device via the Type-C port. After this, my D+ and D- problem came to an end, and I used the CP2102 USB-to-UART converter for this (As my friend suggested this). I also kinda engulfed some stuff inside those boxes for my schematic to look more systematic and organized (and yeah, cooler!). Look at the schematic now:-
