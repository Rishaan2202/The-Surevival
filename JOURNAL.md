# October 4,2025. Day 1! Getting Started!!!
Yooo!!! so it's the Day 1 and I have started making this ultimate Survival tool! I have decided the ESP32 as the MCU.
I also have a few other components in my mind, like BME280, load sensors etc. I have started making a schematic on KiCad and have already added the ESP32 in it.
I wanted to add the ESP with antenna, but that's out of stock in LCSC, so I don't think that I can use that.

# October 6,2025. Day 2! Major change!
<h3> Day 2! Big changes </h3>
Yeah!!! I found ESP32-WROOM-32E-N4 in stock on LCSC! I changed the MCU with it and I also added a BME280 to the schematic. Take a look at the schematic:-
