## 10/7/2025 - Day 1! Let's Begin!!!  

Yooo!!! so it's the Day 1 and I have started making this ultimate Survival tool! I have decided the ESP32 as the MCU. I also have a few other components in my mind, like BME280, load sensors etc. I have started making a schematic on KiCad and have already added the ESP32 in it. I thought that the ESP32-S3 was not available in LCSC, but I found ESP32-WROOM-32E-N4 in stock on LCSC! I changed the MCU with it and I also added a BME280 to the schematic. Take a look at the schematic:-

## 10/12/2025 11:51 AM - Day-2! Progress!!  

So I did the USB Type-C power input connection today for my ESP. I took help from the 'Custom Devboard' guide and the ESP32 datasheet for this, but I can't figure out where to connect the D+ and D- pins! but don't worry, I'll do something for them! Take a look at the Schematic now:-

## 10/12/2025 11:53 AM - Day-3! Even more progress!!!  

Yeah! You see the schematic, it doesn't look like a day 3 schematic but yeah, it is! So today I tried to search for the Load sensors, but couldn't find any SMD one, so I will think upon it. I also tried to figure out that D+ and D- pin thingy, but couldn't come to any conclusion. So I asked for it on #electronics. I hope to get some answers on that. The major thing done today is the connection for BME280 sensor!!! Yeah, it's a great achievement for me!:-

## 10/14/2025 9 PM - Day 4! Done with the USB-to-UART thing!!!  

I did it! One of my friend (Teammate in another project) told me that I had to use the USB to UART feature for the transmission of Data between the MCU and the coding Device via the Type-C port. After this, my D+ and D- problem came to an end, and I used the CP2102 USB-to-UART converter for this (As my friend suggested this). I also kinda engulfed some stuff inside those boxes for my schematic to look more systematic and organized (and yeah, cooler!). Look at the schematic now:-

## 10/14/2025 10 PM - Day 5! Found The Load Sensor!!!  

Yooo!!! So today I was just searching for Load sensors on LCSC, and I found one perfect fit, I mean so perfect for my application, that I just loved it! So when I was goin' through its Datasheet, I found that for that I'll also need an AC-to-DC converter! Then I searched a bit and also found a perfect one for the project, but I kinda struggled to understand why there were different 'pin namings' in the datasheet of both the components. Well, these all things for finding the components, importing symbols and footprints took 30 mins!!! Here's the Schematic for now:-

## 10/15/2025 - Day 6! Added a COMPASS!!!  

Hi Guyzzz!!!, so today I did much work. You can see that the load sensor is done in the schematic, well It was the most difficult part of the schematic! But wait! is there something called the 'Magnetic Field Sensing Unit' in the schematic??? Well, YEAH IT IS!!! I have added a very small 2*2mm compass kinda thing to my schematic, and yeah it is cool. This would be used for navvigation.

## 10/17/2025 - Day 7! Added the SCREEN!!!  

Well today I searched up the whole internet just to find a good GPS and a display for my purpose, but unfortunately I wasn't able to find the GPS, but I found the Display! It is the EA_DOGS164W-A. I did all the Display connections, but the footprint is yet to be added, I'll think upon the GPS thingy later on... Well the schematic looks like this for now!

## 10/18/2025 - Day 8! Display Changed!!!  

Yooo! so I kinda changed the Screen. Yeah, I kinda didn't like that one, so I chose this one and I have this from Digikey. Now I have to order from both LCSC and digikey!!! This means that double shipping fee! But there was no option LCSC just had only 4-5 screens, and those were also not good, so I had to do this. Well the screen's symbol looks like this:-

## 10/19/2025 - Day 9! Some Planning Stuff!!!  

Yoo there! so motivation increased after peeking into the TOOLBAG!!! So yeah, I worked during my holidays,even when I'm 800 Km away from my laptop. Yeah, kinda hard working boy!üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So here is something called the Surevuval Plan (maybe survival plan too). It has a cool SUREVIVAL logo! (designed by me) and it all tells about the current model of the project as well as the future ones. Don't forget to take a quick look at thi thing which tood more than 30 min to be made!

## 10/20/2025 - Day 10! Watched a bit TUTORIALS!!!  

Happy Diwali To All!!! It's kinda biggest festival celebrated in India! So today I watched a bit tutorials on YouTube about the ESP 32 chip and a few of it's peripherals. I wonder what could be the i.age for today!

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/85367e6b5a875c0a2d6495107857e2c70424e337_caa3cad3e9bb986796f547e0309e8024.jpg)  

## 10/21/2025 - Day 11! Edited the README.md!!!  

So today I did some changes in the README.md, cause I needed my project to be a tier 1, so this has to be there for polishing it and it took quite a lot of time!!!

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/5e010132747b241b61084c1cf892efc85e5b26eb_sc.jpeg)  

## 10/26/2025 - Day 12! So here's #ThePlan!!!  

I kinda made a plan, yeah I'm kinda used to make plans after making much of the schematic! ik that's not good, but josh doesn't come with asking! I have decided that I'll be making more than one versions of 'The Surevival'. This is the version 0 (v0) with the least features, which are:-

1) GPS Tracking
2) Estimated lasting of Food and H2O!
3) SurvivO'meter (Kinda prediction of no. of Survival dayzzz!!!

Yeah, ik I revised them, but this was to be done as I am making another project parallely, pls understand the burdening me!!!

Here's the historic #ThePlan-

## 10/28/2025 - Day 13! DONE with the SCHEMATIC!!!  

Yeah!!! So I completed the SCHEMATIC! Hooray! (Nearly 4h work). IDTS that I should be this much happy, but I have completed the schematic within just 13th day of my building! This is a big achievement for me. btw, I also took a harsh decision! And it is that I am gonna use the GPS Neo 6M module and gonna hand solder it, as it is kinda difficult for me design the RF thingy on my board for the antennas myself! I also came to know that the GPS used the UART interphase, which let me add the weather monitoring sensor (BME280) onto my board again! Well I also made the schematic look good by sophisticating and arranging all the stuff and also made the values of each component on my Schematic visible, which I hid before, cause I thought that it was ruining the look of my Schematic, but now I came to know that 'Understandability' is also a factor which shouldn't be ignored by me!!! Now take a look at the Schematic:-
![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/c71de515c4606fae2b42ab9a1fd580b86878bc5d_image.png)


It has been divided into 3 sub-parts, The first one is all the Power related stuff including the battery and it's charger:-

The second part is of the MCU:-

And the last is the main thing which contains all the sensors:-

I hope you liked the schematic, I also asked for review for this an #blueprint on slack! and got some very helpful replies like absence of pull ups for I2C, See this:-

## 10/29/2025 - Day 14! THE FAILURE DAY!!!  

Well, today!!! tbh, it was really non-frustating, interesting and hopeful day! (SARCASM ALERT!!!) I kinda did the footprint of all the components except the Switches and buttons (Yeah I kinda added them today cause they were missing!). I was able to find a good switch for me after so much time, but I didn't have access to its EDA models of KiCad version. I was very tired, but I didn't lose hope! (That's the Spirit). Then I thought to try EasyEDA2KiCad! So, I saw the guide on the Highway website and, IT BLEW MY MIND!!! Bro! I'm not a software guy. So, then I kinda wasted my entire left time arguing with Chat GPT! I also got my cmd full of errors! And yeah Terminal too! So, I thought, that LET'S RETIRE FOR THE DAY!!!

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/dc79079cbbabc98ea0e0b3eb486e07876c7fcbb4_screenshot_2025-10-29_232848.png)  

## 10/30/2025 - Day 15! Finally STARTED THE PCB!!!  

So today I quickly attempted to find good switches, and yeah found them with their footprints and symbols (Feels like HEAVEN)! I added two pushbuttons connected to 2 GPIOs which would indicate any answer of the user for the thing asked on the screen (They are kinda YES/NO switches). Then, I quickly asked Chat GPT about a few pins on my ESP32 and then BOOM! SCHEMATIC-->PCB!!! At first, I saw something like this:-

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/179c53603d476a1189f068de6bf9dac3ae1bb563_screenshot_2025-10-30_173352.png)

Then I thought to BLAST OFF this Battery holder and get a smaller battery, cause literally the Battery holder was bigger than the Entire PCB itself! So, I kept it aside and did the Input stuff and here's the result!

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/fac483eb76e254c9bdbd9db7960f25f6c8f97911_screenshot_2025-10-30_180113.png)  

## 10/31/2025 - Day 16! ROUTING GUYZ!!!  

Hmmm! idts that there is much to tell today, cause today I just ROUTED! Well I also got the 3D model of my ESP32 and could fix it on position after facing a GLITCH! (idk what happened, but the X and Y axis kinda did the same thing). Well, I have asked 'THE LEARNED PEOPLE' on slack to comment on my design on #electronics and am waiting for their helpful replies! Well here is the design which I showed them!

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/59852353c0d50b8245c396b5893ee829c47d289c_image.png)  

## 11/1/2025 - Day 17! PCB DONE!!! (kinda)  

Hi!!! Do you remember the routing that you saw in the yesterday's journal entry? It was not so cool ig. And I also thought that the project was also not planned properly, so today I did this:-

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/f93a8a10c6f5cc5c697edfcb48fa4cac73f2e5ea_objects__sizes_1.jpg)

Yeah! I kinda drew the approx. sizes of all the components, so that I can decide how to place them. Now, see this:-

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/4bd9c37b7e200ca960cd4636d5a42732bb66fd62_whatsapp_image_2025-11-01_at_17.14.48_0eb44a50.jpg)

This was supposed to be the placement of all the components! Wait!!! Did I just say 'WAS'? Yup, I did! While I was designing the PCB, I kinda changed the placement of a few components and then I routed mostly the whole PCB and finally here was the output!

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/0981fcb5e374e85bf5bf1c2e2a3f83548873513d_image.png)

And the thing which looks the best is yet to come, and that's the 3D MODEL!!!

![image](//hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/daf40a6cd1f262b878c533976f5a5dd32e364061_screenshot_2025-11-01_190949.png)

The whole PCB is mostly done, just the thing which I need to add is that I need to add a connector for the battery and have to remove the switch which was connected to the MCU! So yeah, that's for today! Have a great day!!!
