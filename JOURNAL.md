## 10/7/2025 - Day 1! Let's Begin!!!  

Yooo!!! so it's the Day 1 and I have started making this ultimate Survival tool! I have decided the ESP32 as the MCU. I also have a few other components in my mind, like BME280, load sensors etc. I have started making a schematic on KiCad and have already added the ESP32 in it. I thought that the ESP32-S3 was not available in LCSC, but I found ESP32-WROOM-32E-N4 in stock on LCSC! I changed the MCU with it and I also added a BME280 to the schematic. Take a look at the schematic:-

## 10/12/2025 - Day-2! Progress!!  

So I did the USB Type-C power input connection today for my ESP. I took help from the 'Custom Devboard' guide and the ESP32 datasheet for this, but I can't figure out where to connect the D+ and D- pins! but don't worry, I'll do something for them! Take a look at the Schematic now:-
