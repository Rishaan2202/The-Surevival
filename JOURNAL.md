## 10/7/2025 - Day 1! Let's Begin!!!  

Yooo!!! so it's the Day 1 and I have started making this ultimate Survival tool! I have decided the ESP32 as the MCU. I also have a few other components in my mind, like BME280, load sensors etc. I have started making a schematic on KiCad and have already added the ESP32 in it. I thought that the ESP32-S3 was not available in LCSC, but I found ESP32-WROOM-32E-N4 in stock on LCSC! I changed the MCU with it and I also added a BME280 to the schematic. Take a look at the schematic:-

## 10/12/2025 11:51 AM - Day-2! Progress!!  

So I did the USB Type-C power input connection today for my ESP. I took help from the 'Custom Devboard' guide and the ESP32 datasheet for this, but I can't figure out where to connect the D+ and D- pins! but don't worry, I'll do something for them! Take a look at the Schematic now:-

## 10/12/2025 11:53 AM - Day-3! Even more progress!!!  

Yeah! You see the schematic, it doesn't look like a day 3 schematic but yeah, it is! So today I tried to search for the Load sensors, but couldn't find any SMD one, so I will think upon it. I also tried to figure out that D+ and D- pin thingy, but couldn't come to any conclusion. So I asked for it on #electronics. I hope to get some answers on that. The major thing done today is the connection for BME280 sensor!!! Yeah, it's a great achievement for me!:-

## 10/14/2025 9 PM - Day 4! Done with the USB-to-UART thing!!!  

I did it! One of my friend (Teammate in another project) told me that I had to use the USB to UART feature for the transmission of Data between the MCU and the coding Device via the Type-C port. After this, my D+ and D- problem came to an end, and I used the CP2102 USB-to-UART converter for this (As my friend suggested this). I also kinda engulfed some stuff inside those boxes for my schematic to look more systematic and organized (and yeah, cooler!). Look at the schematic now:-

## 10/14/2025 10 PM - Day 5! Found The Load Sensor!!!  

Yooo!!! So today I was just searching for Load sensors on LCSC, and I found one perfect fit, I mean so perfect for my application, that I just loved it! So when I was goin' through its Datasheet, I found that for that I'll also need an AC-to-DC converter! Then I searched a bit and also found a perfect one for the project, but I kinda struggled to understand why there were different 'pin namings' in the datasheet of both the components. Well, these all things for finding the components, importing symbols and footprints took 30 mins!!! Here's the Schematic for now:-

## 10/15/2025 - Day 6! Added a COMPASS!!!  

Hi Guyzzz!!!, so today I did much work. You can see that the load sensor is done in the schematic, well It was the most difficult part of the schematic! But wait! is there something called the 'Magnetic Field Sensing Unit' in the schematic??? Well, YEAH IT IS!!! I have added a very small 2*2mm compass kinda thing to my schematic, and yeah it is cool. This would be used for navvigation.

## 10/17/2025 - Day 7! Added the SCREEN!!!  

Well today I searched up the whole internet just to find a good GPS and a display for my purpose, but unfortunately I wasn't able to find the GPS, but I found the Display! It is the EA_DOGS164W-A. I did all the Display connections, but the footprint is yet to be added, I'll think upon the GPS thingy later on... Well the schematic looks like this for now!
