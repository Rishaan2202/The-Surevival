# Day 2! Progress!!!
So I did the USB Type-C power input connection today for my ESP. I took help from the 'Custom Devboard' guide and the ESP32 datasheet for this, but I can't figure out where to connect the D+ and D- pins! but don't worry, I'll do something for them! Take a  look at the Schematic now:-

# Day 3! Even more progress!!!
Yeah! You see the schematic, it doesn't look like a day 3 schematic but yeah, it is! So today I tried to search for the Load sensors, but couldn't find any SMD one, so I will think upon it. I also tried to figure out that D+ and D- pin thingy, but couldn't come to any conclusion. So I asked for it on #electronics. I hope to get some answers on that. The major thing done today is the connection for BME280 sensor!!! Yeah, it's a great achievement for me!:-
