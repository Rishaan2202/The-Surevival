# The-Surevival

<h2>Intro!!!</h2>
Yooo there!!! I am Rishaan Sharma, a 14 year old Indian. I am making this project, 'The Surevival' as a survival tool.
<br>
I'll be making this on KiCad, and yeah I'm a beginner! It's going to be a very interesting project, so please do check out for the Journal!

<h2>OVERVIEW ü§î</h2>
So this is gonna be a project on a PCB, whose parts are to be ordered via LCSC and Digikey (ig). I will try to make this a bit systematic and polished for attaining higher quality and tier. I will be using an ESP32-S3-WROOM-32E-N4 as the MCU. It's my first time making a project like this one with an MCU. I will be using a few PERIFERALS for making it a useful survival tool and yeah! That's all for the OVERVIEW.
