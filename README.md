# The-Surevival

<h2> Intro!!! </h2>
Yooo there!!! I am Rishaan Sharma, a 14 year old Indian. I made this project, 'The Surevival' as a project in hcb!
<br>
I have made this on KiCad, and yeah I'm a beginner! It's a very interesting project, which was attained after repetitive feilures, so please do check out for the Journal to know all that in detail!

<h2>OVERVIEW 🤔</h2>
So this is gonna be a project on a PCB, which is a PCBA (Yeah, cause I don't even have a soldering iron!), and yeah, It's my first PCB!!! It is basically a tool whose name suggests that it's a 'Survival Tool' (Sure + Survival = SUREVIVAL). Yeah, cool name rigth, ik! This is supposed to have a few features which are listed below! I have used the ESP32-S3FN8 as the MCU! and am having a Type-C input which is just for charging the battery! The 2000mAh Li-ion battery is gonna power up all the stuff like the load sensor, temp. sensor etc... So yeah, It's a cool thing and now take a look at it's features!!!

<h2>FEATURES ⚡️</h2>
1) GPS Tracking 
<br>
2) No. of Survival Dayzzz prediction using food! (My favorite)
<br>
3) Weather Monitoring
<br>
4) OLED Display!!! (For better UI)

<h2> THE SCHEMATIC </h2>

<br>

<h3>It consists of 4 units, and These units further contain subunits which are lister below:</h3>
<br>

<h3>1) MCU!!! </h3>
<br>

<h3> 2) Power Management: </h3>
- Input Processing Unit (IPU) <br>
- Buck-Boost converter <br>
- Battery Charging Unit (BCU)
<br>

<h3> 3) Peripherals: </h3>
-Load Sensing Unit (Weight Sensor) <br>
- Switches (UI bro!) <br>
- GPS (ofc.) <br>
- Weather Monitoring Unit (WMU) <br>
- Display (OLED)
<br>

<h3>4) Crystal!</h3>
<br>


<h2>THE PCB</h2>

<h3> SO this is all the placement and routing stuff! It was really Time-Consuming!!! </h3>

<br>

<h3> idts that I need to explain a lot about the PCB, but yeah, I must compliment it's compactness, cause it's just 23mm*51mm </h3>
<br>
<br>

<h2>THE 3D Look (My fav!)</h2>

<h3> So yeah, I kinda like this part, cause it shows how would it be looking when it comes outside the screen (im in real world)! </h3>

<h3> Let's take a look at the one without much of the components, but with the OLED, which was placed by me on KiCad! </h3>

<br>

<h3> Now, let's see the one with all the components on it except the OLED and the GPS, which was produced by JLCPCB! </h3>
<br>

<h3> Yeah, that's so cool! I can't even believe that I made that! </h3>
<br>
<br>

<h2>THE BOM</h2>

<h3> Hmmm, so here is the tricky part! It took me many days to make this thing! I also tried to add a soldering kit to this, as I need that to put a few components on this, but then I came to know that I can't do that , so I removed that and now the BOM is $86.28 (JLCPCB) + $13.52 (Robocraze). Yeah I have 2 suppliers, one for PCBA and the other for some extra components which has $0 as it is originally from INDIA (As I am!) </h3>

<h3> Well, this doesn't contain the price of the PCBA products, but that will be clear by looking at this </h3>

<h2>OUTRO!!!</h2>
<br>

Yeah, so this was the first PCB built by me, I have already made one before, but because of some unignorable things, I will need to redesign it. Well if you want to give any kinda comment regarding this project, then pls feel free to contact me. Here are my details:
