# The-Surevival

<h2>Intro!!!</h2>
Yooo there!!! I am Rishaan Sharma, a 14 year old Indian. I made this project, 'The Surevival' as a project in hcb!
<br>
I have made this on KiCad, and yeah I'm a beginner! It's a very interesting project, which was attained after repetitive feilures, so please do check out for the Journal to know all that in detail!

<h2>OVERVIEW 🤔</h2>
So this is gonna be a project on a PCB, which is a PCBA (Yeah, cause I don't even have a soldering iron!), and yeah, It's my first PCB!!! It is basically a tool whose name suggests that it's a 'Survival Tool' (Sure + Survival = SUREVIVAL). Yeah, cool name rigth, ik! This is supposed to have a few features which are listed below! I have used the ESP32-S3FN8 as the MCU! and am having a Type-C input which is just for charging the battery! The 2000mAh Li-ion battery is gonna power up all the stuff like the load sensor, temp. sensor etc... So yeah, It's a cool thing and now take a look at it's features!!!

<h2>FEATURES ⚡️</h2>
1) GPS Tracking 
<br>
2) No. of Survival Dayzzz prediction using food! (My favorite)
<br>
3) Weather Monitoring
<br>
4) OLED Display!!! (For better UI)
